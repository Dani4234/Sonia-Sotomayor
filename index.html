            <p> My name is Sonia Sotomayor and I am running for the upcomming 2020 Presidential Elections. I would like to have your vote because I belive that this country should have a better educational system and better wages for everyone regardless of their political status.In addition I believe that every one should have the chance to go to college and pursue a career. I want to fix the educational structure our country has and give the children the support and advancement they need. Our country needs someone who will care about their needs and give importance to every problem in order to achieve a better place and community for everyone to live in and participate in. </p>
